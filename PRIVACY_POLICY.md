# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 5, 2026

## 1. Information Collection
**Twitch Top Clips** ("we") is a self-hosted, simplified automation tool. We do not operate a central server that collects your personal data.
*   **Local Data:** All data processing (video downloading, editing) happens locally on your machine or your own server infrastructure.
*   **API Tokens:** Authorization tokens (e.g., for Twitch or TikTok) are stored temporarily in your local session or environment variables and are used solely to communicate directly with the respective platforms.

## 2. Data Usage
We use the information you provide (e.g., API keys, video content) strictly to:
*   Fetch video clips from Twitch.
*   Process video files (crop, overlay text).
*   Upload content to your specified TikTok account upon your request.

## 3. Third-Party Services
Our Service interacts with third-party APIs:
*   **Twitch API:** To retrieve clip data.
*   **TikTok API:** To publish videos.
Please review the privacy policies of these third-parties to understand how they handle your data.

## 4. Data Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties. Since the application runs locally, your data remains under your control.

## 5. Security
You are responsible for keeping your API credentials (Client Keys, Secrets) secure. We recommend using environment variables (`.env`) and never committing secrets to public repositories.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

## 7. Contact
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the repository owner via GitHub issues.
